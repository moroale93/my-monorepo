# My monorepo

This monorepo contains tools, apps and libraries for my personal projects.

At the moment, it contains:
- `react-iframe-syncher`: A library for synching the state of a React component with perfect isolation from the rest of the application.
- `example-my-isolated-application`: An example of a React application that uses `react-iframe-syncher`.
- `example-my-application`: An example of a React application that uses `react-iframe-syncher` to hosts an isolated application.
- `me`: My personal website.
- `puzzle`: A puzzle game application.

This repo is has been built with my [Monorepo CLI](https://github.com/moroale93/my-monorepo).
